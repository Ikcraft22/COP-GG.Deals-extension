# GG.deals Extension

Browser extension that shows GG.deals prices while you shop and keeps your game
libraries in sync with your GG.deals account. Chrome and Firefox, Manifest V3.

## What It Does

- **Price bar.** On a supported store or game-info page, a bar shows the current
  GG.deals retail and keyshop prices for that game and flags historical lows.
  66 site integrations ship with the extension; the bar only appears on a page
  one of them recognises, and you can exclude any domain from the Appearance
  tab.
- **Library sync.** Link an account on the GG.deals extension settings page and
  import from Steam (library, wishlist, ignore list), Epic (library), or
  PlayStation (collection, wishlist).
- **Popup.** The toolbar icon opens the current page's deals, your sync and
  account options, and the bar's appearance settings.

The extension asks for `storage` and access to all `https://` sites. The broad
host access is what lets the price bar recognise product pages across the stores
listed in `src/manifest.json`.

## Build

To build this project, you'll need Node.js `^20.19.0 || >=22.12.0` (Vite 7's
requirement).

```bash
npm install
npm run build:all    # builds the extension for Chrome and Firefox in one go
```

## Load the Extension in Chrome (Unpacked)

1. Build the project first:

   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   ```

2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer mode.
4. Click Load unpacked.
5. Select the `dist/gg.deals_chrome/` folder.

## Load the Extension in Firefox (Temporary Add-on)

Requires Firefox 140 or newer.

1. Build the project first:

   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   ```

2. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging`.
3. Click This Firefox.
4. Click Load Temporary Add-on.
5. Select `dist/gg.deals_firefox/manifest.json`.

## Making a Change

`npm run build:all` does everything: it compiles the Less stylesheets,
type-checks, bundles with Vite and CRXJS, then flattens the output and patches
the manifest for each browser. Rebuild and reload the extension to see a change.

Where things live:

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `src/manifest.json` | The manifest, shared by both targets, and the list of supported sites |
| `src/bar/` | The price bar - `integrations/` holds one page rule per site |
| `src/integrations/` | Steam, Epic, and PlayStation sync flows |
| `src/settings/` | The popup UI (Preact) |
| `src/background.ts` | Background script - all provider API calls |
| `src/content-settings.ts` | Content script for GG.deals pages |
| `src/utils/` | Shared settings, sync, and i18n helpers |
| `public/_locales/` | Translations, 14 locales, default `en` |
| `scripts/build.mjs` | The build itself |

Adding a site to the price bar means writing a page rule under
`src/bar/integrations/`, registering it in that directory's `index.ts`, and
adding the site's match patterns to `src/manifest.json`.

## Build Options

Flags go after `--`, for example `npm run build:all -- --debug`.

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--target=<chrome\|firefox\|all>` | Which browsers to build. |
| `--debug` | Keeps `console` calls and the bar's request-debugging panel, and writes to a `debug_`-prefixed directory. |
| `--site=<domain[/path]>` | Builds against another installation, rewriting both the manifest domain and the site URLs in the code so the two can't disagree. Accepts a subdirectory, e.g. `example.com/subdir/`. |
| `--version=<x.y.z>` | Sets the version instead of deriving one. |
| `--version-base=<x.y.z>` | Sets the release base offline, skipping the git tag lookup. |

Output directories follow `dist/<site>_<target>/`, so `--site=example.com`
produces `dist/example.com_chrome/`. Versions are derived from the latest
released tag plus a counter, so dev builds always sort above the released
extension.
